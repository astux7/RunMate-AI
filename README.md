# RunMate AI 🏃

An AI-powered running companion that helps runners discover races appropriate to their experience level and location. Now featuring a modern local web application.

## Features

- **Race Discovery** — finds official races matching your level, location, distance, and month
- **Parkrun Fallback** — automatically searches for nearby Parkrun events when no official races are found
- **AI Recommendations** — explains why each race suits you, with beginner-friendly guidance
- **Multi-Agent Architecture** — Coach, Race Search, Recommendation, and Output agents work together
- **Web Dashboard** — Interactive responsive layout with runner profile settings, search history, and live SSE progress streaming
- **Cloud-Ready** — business logic is decoupled for both web interface and CLI usage

## Quick Start

python runmate.py --level RUNNER --location "London" --distance "Half Marathon" --month "October"

# Marathon runner in Berlin — searches all upcoming months
python runmate.py --level RUNNER --location "Berlin" --distance "Marathon"

# Save the report to output/
